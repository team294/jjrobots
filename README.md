# jjrobots
Java robot virtual arena

To play, clone this project from GitHub and import it into Eclipse.  All of the source files are in the "src" directory.  The core simulation/arena files are JJxxxx.java -- do not modify these files.  You should be able to build this either as a Java applet or a Java application.

Each robot needs its code to be in a separate file with the name in the format of __RobotName_.java (two underscores, then the robot name, then one underscore).  For robot programming details, see http://jrobots.sourceforge.net/jjr_info.shtml
